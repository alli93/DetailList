# DetailList
A simple phone application written in react-native, developed and tested on android devices using Expo as part of a course in
app development for Reykjav√≠k University.

The data set found in the data/ folder is used in conjunction with the SectionList component to produce
a large, scrollable sectioned list. Each list item can then be pushed to navigate to a detailed contact page.
